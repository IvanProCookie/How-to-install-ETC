# How to Install SpoTube  
(*There is no website version, but the app is safe and virus-free!.;3*)  

## 1. Downloading SpoTube  
- Go to the official website:  
  - [https://spotube.krtirtho.dev](https://spotube.krtirtho.dev).  
- Visit the downloads page:  
  - [https://spotube.krtirtho.dev/downloads](https://spotube.krtirtho.dev/downloads).  
- Click **"Install for Android"** (should be the first button).  

## 2. Installing SpoTube  
- Wait for the download to finish, then open the file.  
- Follow the installation process until it is successfully installed.  
- Open the app.  

## 3. Setting Up SpoTube  
- Follow the on-screen instructions, or press **"Skip This Nonsense"** in the top-right corner.  
- Choose whether to connect **Spotify** or browse anonymously.  

## 4. Important Notes About Spotify Connection  
### 4.1. If you connect to Spotify:  
- Any changes made to playlists will transfer to your Spotify account, including:  
  - Adding/removing songs from playlists or liked songs.  
  - Renaming or deleting playlists.  
- Changes to your account will also sync, such as:  
  - Following/unfollowing artists.  
  - Saving/removing albums.  
  - Organizing songs into folders.  
- **This isn't a bad thing, just something to be aware of.**  

### 4.2. If you don't want this:  
- You can **log out of Spotify** from the settings menu.  
- Logging out prevents any changes from syncing to Spotify while still allowing you to use SpoTube.  
- Logging out is the same as using **Anonymous Mode** I'm pretty sure?.:3  

## 5. Enjoy!  
- I highly recommend exploring the app, especially the **Settings** and **Statistics** pages!.;3
