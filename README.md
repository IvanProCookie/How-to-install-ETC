# How to Install SpoTube  
(*There is no website version, but the app is safe and virus-free!.;3*)  

## 1. Downloading SpoTube  
- Go to the official website:  
  - [https://spotube.krtirtho.dev](https://spotube.krtirtho.dev).  
- Visit the downloads page:  
  - [https://spotube.krtirtho.dev/downloads](https://spotube.krtirtho.dev/downloads).  
- Click **"Install for Android"** (should be the first button).  

## 2. Installing SpoTube  
- Wait for the download to finish, then open the file.  
- Follow the installation process until it is successfully installed.  
- Open the app.  

## 3. Setting Up SpoTube  
- Follow the on-screen instructions, or press **"Skip This Nonsense"** button in the top-right hand corner.  
- Choose whether to connect to **Spotify** or browse anonymously. (more said about this later!)  

## 4. Important Notes About Spotify Connection  
- ### 4.1. If you connect to Spotify:  
- Any changes made to playlists will transfer to your Spotify account, including:  
  - Adding/removing songs from playlists or liked songs.  
  - Renaming or deleting playlists.  
- Changes to your account will also sync, such as:  
  - Following/unfollowing artists.  
  - Saving/removing albums.  
  - Organizing songs into folders.  
- **This isn't a bad thing, just something to be aware of.**  

- ### 4.2. If you don't want what'slisted above:  
- You can click the **log out** (of Spotify) button in the settings menu.  
- Logging out doesn’t change anything in Spotify, it just makes it so that you can use SpoTube without it syncing to Spotify, (I don't know if all the data, playlists, artists, albums, will stay, but you can always connect it back?).
- Logging out is the same as using **Anonymous Mode**, I'm pretty sure?.:3  

## 5. Pros/Cons:
- ### 5.1. Pros
  - It's completely free with no *in-app* purchases.  
  - You can download the tracks for offline listening, and they save to a folder (/emulated/0/downloads/Spotube/ by default) that you can access, (and so you can move the track(s) to another drive, (e.g, a USB stick, an MP3 player, a Computer)!)
  - No Ads through-out the entire app or any of the tracks **at all**!
  - Synced Lyrics on *most* tracks, and even some local tracks (if they support it)!
  - Statistics that tell you about your listening and other stuff/things, like how much you saved if you were to pay for Spotify and *support the artists*.
  - ***Really*** simple user-interface.
  - The ability to use not just YouTube(Music) for streaming, but also Piped, Invidious, and some other -end I forgot!
  - ***I use it!***
  - *And more..!*

- ### 5.2. Cons
  - The music selection might be a *tad* bit smaller than Spotify, but idk.  
  - You can't listen to Podcasts on it.
  - You can't watch any shows on it.
  - You can't look at **Song Previews** on it..: (  
  - You can't use Spotify's **"Jam"** feature.  
  - You can't really interact with your *non-artist* **followers** and **following**.  
  - It has *quite a few* bugs.
  - Listening to the music doesn't support any of the creators/artists.
  - *And probably more...*


## 6. Enjoy!  
- I highly recommend exploring the app, especially the **Settings** and **Statistics** pages!.;3
